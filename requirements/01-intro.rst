Introduction
============

For telecom applications, the resource scheduler needs much more information of
network for resource allocation besides CPU and memory data. Upstream project
OpenStack is short of functions to monitor and collect information from network
for many applications. This project would collect more network information, do
resource isolation and make Enhanced Scheduler so that resource allocation could
be more efficient.

Problem description
-------------------

The purpose of this requirement project is to clarify the necessary features of
NFVI resouce schedulor, identify missing features in the current OpenSource
implementations, provide a potential implementation architecture and plan,
provide implementation guidelines in relevant upstream projects to realize those
missing features, and maintenance in alignment with ETSI NFV.
